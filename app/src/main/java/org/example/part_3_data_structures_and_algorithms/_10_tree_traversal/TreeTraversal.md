# 10. Tree Traversal

There are multiple ways to do tree traversal.

1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search

## Breadth First Search

```
     47
  21    76
18 27  52 82
```

BFS = [47, 21 76, 18, 27, 52, 82]

## Depth First Search

```
     47
  21    76
18 27  52 82
```

DFS PreOrder = [47, 21, 18, 27, 76, 52, 82]
DFS PostOrder = [18, 27, 21, 52, 82, 76, 47]
DFS InOrder = [18, 21, 27, 47, 52, 76, 82]
