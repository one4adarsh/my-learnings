# 12. Dynamic Programming

There are 2 things that are required to use dynamic programming

1. Overlapping Subproblems
2. Optimized Substructure

## Overlapping Subproblems

```
Problem 
  |
Break it down in multiple sub problems
  |
Solve each sub problem
  |
Put them all back together
  |
Solve the overall problem
```

- The process of storing the solution of sub-problems is called Memoization.

## Optimized Substructure

- Optimized solution of a sub-problem should also be optimized solution of bigger problem
