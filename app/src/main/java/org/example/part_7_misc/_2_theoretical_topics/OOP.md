# OOP

> Abstraction

- only essential details are displayed to the user
- abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes
  - we can achieve 100% abstraction using interfaces

> Encapsulation

- wrapping up of data under a single unit
- the variables in a class are hidden from any other class
  - it can be accessed only through any member function of the class in which they are declared

> Inheritance

- one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class
- using `extends` keyword
- superclass i.e parent
- subclass i.e child

> Polymorphism

- Method Overloading â€“ compile time polymorphism
  - one method shares the same name with different arguments in a class

- Method Overriding - run time polymorphism
  - one method in child class has the same name with the same arguments and return type as in parent class
